Add 3D Models — glTF Model Animations
Models can come with animations. The model provided above has many animations of ships zooming across the city. In the previous Glitch, we've provided a simple play-all-model-animations component that we can attach to our model to play its animations. Continue working from your current Glitch.

1. Include the animation-mixer component via a <script> in the <head> after the A-Frame script. This component is currently in the Registry, and may one day be included with A-Frame. https://unpkg.com/aframe-extras.animation-mixer@3.4.0/dist/aframe-extras.animation-mixer.js
2. Attach the animation-mixer component to the <a-gltf-model> by setting it via an HTML attribute animation-mixer. By default, this will play all the animations of the model at once.

Add 3D Models — Uploading 3D Models
If you have a model of your own, it can be tricky to upload it to a CDN since it consists of multiple files that reference each other. So far the easiest way we've found is to dump them into a GitHub repo, publish the repo's master branch to GitHub Pages, and use rawgit.com to serve them. Alternatively, set up Amazon S3. More to come.
