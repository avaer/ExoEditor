<!--
Add 3D Models â€” glTF Model
3D models are like the images of 3D and VR applications, although a bit heavier. A 3D model is created beforehand in a 3D modeling program such as Blender and consists of vertices, textures, materials. We recommend using glTF, a relatively new 3D file format standard tailored for the Web. glTF is like the JPG of 3D models.


1. Add the https://cdn.aframe.io/test-models/models/virtualcity/VC.gltf to the <a-asset-item id="cityModel">'s src attribute to preload the model
2. Add #cityModel to the <a-gltf-model>'s src attribute to set and add the model
